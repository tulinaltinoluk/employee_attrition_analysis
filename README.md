Attrition Rates in Hospital Employees using SQL Server in EDA and Power BI in Visualization

In this project, I did a department, job role and gender based exploratory analysis to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition or compare average monthly income by education and attrition’.

Using a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists, I searched for an answer to following questions:

Which department has the most and the least satisfied employees,
Which job role feels worn out the most, 
What are some possible reasons for employee satisfaction.
